## Principal Investigator - Prof. Gavin McNicol

Hello! Thanks for visiting the ecoÏ•lab website. My interest in atmosphere-biosphere interactions began early in my life on the Isle of Skye, in the NW Highlands of Scotland. Our deforested landscape of sphagnum bogs, heather moorland, and post-glacial mountains is a dynamic watercolor scene that shifts in tone and hue with the passing seasons - sometimes more than one in a single day! These wet landscape led me to a doctoral investigation of wetland carbon biogeochemistry restored marsh ecosystems in the California Delta, followed by postdoctoral training to scale using bookkeeping and machine learning approaches. My passions outside of science are music - especially of the uplifting variety - and reading about philosophy and theology. I love spaceship Earth and hope we can work together to improve our stewardship of it's incredible ecology.

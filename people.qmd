Hello! Thanks for visiting the ecoϕlab website. My interest in atmosphere-biosphere interactions began early in my life on the Isle of Skye, in the NW Highlands of Scotland. Our deforested landscape of sphagnum bogs, heather moorland, and post-glacial mountains is a dynamic watercolor scene that shifts in tone and hue with the passing seasons - sometimes more than one in a single day! These wet landscapes led me to a doctoral investigation of wetland carbon biogeochemistry in restored marsh ecosystems in the California Delta, followed by postdoctoral training to scale waste sector greenhouse gas avoidance, map rainforest soil carbon, and estimate global wetland methane emissions using bookkeeping and machine learning approaches. The biggest shift in my thinking since beginning at the University of Illinois Chicago is that I now believe our work must seek a harmonious balance between local conservation goals and global change concerns. I love spaceship Earth and hope we can work together to improve our stewardship of it's incredible ecology.

I am Junior Jules Francois, a PhD candidate in the ecoϕlab within the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago. My research focuses on soil greenhouse gas fluxes in both natural ecosystems, such as prairies, and managed systems, such as urban agriculture. These landscapes provide important environmental benefits, including carbon sequestration, as well as ecosystem services such as food production and recreation. I am interested in understanding their individual and collective contributions to building more sustainable urban landscapes. I enjoy combining fieldwork and laboratory analysis, and I hope my research will help foster greater harmony between urban environments and the people who live in them.

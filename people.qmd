Hello! Thanks for visiting the ecoÏ•lab website. My interest in atmosphere-biosphere interactions began early in my life on the Isle of Skye, in the NW Highlands of Scotland. Our deforested landscape of sphagnum bogs, heather moorland, and post-glacial mountains is a dynamic watercolor scene that shifts in tone and hue with the passing seasons - sometimes more than one in a single day! These wet landscapes led me to a doctoral investigation of wetland carbon biogeochemistry restored marsh ecosystems in the California Delta, followed by postdoctoral training to scale waste sector greenhouse gas avoidance, map rainforest soil carbon, and estimate global wetland methane emissions using bookkeeping and machine learning approaches. The biggest shift in my thinking since beginning at the University of Illinois Chicago is that I now believe our work must seek a harmonious balance between local conservation goals and global change concerns. I love spaceship Earth and hope we can work together to improve our stewardship of it's incredible ecology.

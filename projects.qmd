## AI for Natural Methane

![](images/clipboard-15137423.png)

Methane concentrations in our planet's atmosphere have fluctuated widely through geological time and our observations of these changes can tell us a lot about the health of our planet. We live today in a time of **an unprecedented rise atmospheric methane**, which we know reflect changes in, and can impact, terrestrial ecosystem processes encompassing the lifestyles of soil microbes, plants and animals, and humankind.

Yet we are also living in time of rapidly improving technologies to monitor, interpret, and predict changes in methane. One such change is the rapid growth in artificial intelligence (AI), which allows to automate the extraction of scientific insights from big data and learn about methane sources and sinks more accurately, faster, and at larger scales than ever before. These key advances including the use of **knowledge guided machine learning (KGML)**, which is a flexible and modular workflow approach to AI that enables many ways of combining knowledge from well-established ecological theory with the pattern-recognition prowess of ML.

We at the ecoÏ†lab are advancing these KGML projects within **AI for Natural Methane** - a working group of the The Environmental Data Science Innovation & Impact Lab (*ESIIL*), which is supported by the National Science Foundation. Our participants include collaborators at U.S. federal agencies including the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric (NOAA) Administration, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA), as well with with other academic institutions including Stanford University, Yale University, and the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

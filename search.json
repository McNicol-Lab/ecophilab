    "text": "Gavin on East Glacier Trail, Juneau, AK\n\n\n\n\nHello! Thanks for visiting the ecoϕlab website. My interest in atmosphere-biosphere interactions began early in my life on the Isle of Skye, in the NW Highlands of Scotland. Our deforested landscape of sphagnum bogs, heather moorland, and post-glacial mountains is a dynamic watercolor scene that shifts in tone and hue with the passing seasons - sometimes more than one in a single day! These wet landscapes led me to a doctoral investigation of wetland carbon biogeochemistry restored marsh ecosystems in the California Delta, followed by postdoctoral training to scale waste sector greenhouse gas avoidance, map rainforest soil carbon, and estimate global wetland methane emissions using bookkeeping and machine learning approaches. The biggest shift in my thinking since beginning at the University of Illinois Chicago is that I now believe our work must seek a harmonious balance between local conservation goals and global change concerns. I love spaceship Earth and hope we can work together to improve our stewardship of it’s incredible ecology."

    "text": "Temperate Rainforest Geoecology\n\nTemperate rainforests are the ecosystems we forgot and almost lost. Dripping wet and cool year-round, these rare forests accumulate vast amounts of organic matter across saturated landscapes that blur our conventional distinction between upland and wetland. Orographic cooling supplies the moisture for temperate rainforests, so they’re found draped across the steepest post-glacial mountain ranges in each major continent. Yet each rainforest tapestry is uniquely vulnerable to change, and human actions in many regions have left this ecological blanket much fragmented, especially in Europe. Fortunately, the largest temperate rainforest of the N. American Pacific coast, that extends from sub-polar Gulf of Alaska south to the coastal redwoods of California, is also the most intact globally. We study these ecosystems for the rare second-chance they offer us to understand the forming and stabilizing factors that sustain this remarkable habitat for endemic bryophytes, sentinel trees, animals, and humankind.\nOur Alaskan coastal temperate rainforest research is currently supported by a US DOE BER Environmental System Science program award (2024-2027) and the ecoφlab’s rainforest network was established with past NSF support for a Coastal Margins Research Coordination Network."

McNicol, April 22, 2022\n\nChicago is the Midwestern heart of the North American continent. All pass through these crossroads, but who can stay? Chicago’s built environment offers convenience, leisurely abundance, and an apparent overcoming of Nature’s chaotic and hostile forms. But our work in today’s Chicagolands focuses on something different; we take time to understand how the tiniest fragments of native soils persist, embedded in this vast expanse of human transformation. What might we lose if we forsake the last of these rare natural environments? In our most ambitious wetland restoration project yet, we pursue the answer to a question that the Chicagoan feat of engineering has almost obviated. Which of these expeirments in land use will prevail? Can what appears to be a flat shallows be in fact a terrain of elevation?"

As ecophiles, we try to balance empirical observation and experimentation with the logos evident in nature."

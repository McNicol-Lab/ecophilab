My interest in atmosphere-biosphere interactions began early in my life on the Isle of Skye, in the NW Highlands of Scotland. Our deforested landscape of sphagnum bogs, heather moorland, and post-glacial mountains is a dynamic watercolor scene that shifts in tone and hue with the passing seasons - sometimes more than one in a single day! These wet landscapes led me to a doctoral investigation of wetland carbon biogeochemistry in restored marsh ecosystems in the California Delta, followed by postdoctoral training to scale waste sector greenhouse gas avoidance, map rainforest soil carbon, and estimate global wetland methane emissions using bookkeeping and machine learning approaches. The biggest shift in my thinking since beginning at the University of Illinois Chicago is that I now believe our work must seek a harmonious balance between local conservation goals and global change concerns. I love spaceship Earth and hope we can improve our stewardship of it’s incredible ecology."

This commitments is rooted in an axiomatic belief; that of the transformative ideal of unity in diversity. This phrasing originated in the writings ofʻAbdu’l-Bahá, who was the son of the visionary founder of the Bahá’í faith, Baháʼu’lláh. I find itmost apt because it emphasizes the interdependent equality of both diversity and unity. Latent in the phrase, there is also a warning that, promoted alone, these ideals may seed division or coerce uniformity, respectively.\nBeyond my own perspective, our present opportunity to engage conversations about diversity, equity, and inclusion in the context of scientific research inspires me profoundly at a personal level, and leaves me anxious to realize these ideals as best I can through my scientific work. I’m inspired personally because I have many times been told that science as an institution is naturally antagonistic to articles of faith, among which are commitments to ethical ideals, i.e., virtues. Indeed, I absorbed this same antagonistic mantra as a graduate student. But, having experienced directly and indirectly, and perceiving broadly, a profound inconsistency between the purported ethics of science and the conduct of scientists and the culture of their institutions, this antagonism left me disillusioned about the potential for science to achieve the cultural changes necessary to resolve these ethical problems.\nI now feel a renewed hope because I share the belief that we must, as scientists, strive for better personal conduct and collective culture, and a part of this striving demands a deeper reflection of the meaning and purpose of ethical ideals. I believe promoting universal inclusion grounded in a shared mission is a vehicle to advance our discourse of and better realize diversity, equity, and inclusion professional work settings and that it can ultimately lead us down a path to a more unified scientific community.\nI maintain five overarching commitments to advancing universal inclusion in my management of the Ecosystem and Planetary Health Integration Lab.

    "text": "Temperate Rainforest Geoecology\n\nTemperate rainforests are the ecosystems we forgot and almost lost. Dripping wet and cool year-round, these rare forests accumulate vast amounts of organic matter across saturated landscapes that blur our conventional distinction between upland and wetland. Orographic cooling supplies the moisture for temperate rainforests, so they’re found draped across the steepest post-glacial mountain ranges in each major continent. Yet each rainforest tapestry is uniquely vulnerable to change, and human actions in many regions have left this ecological blanket much fragmented, especially in Europe. Fortunately, the largest temperate rainforest of the N. American Pacific coast, that extends from sub-polar Gulf of Alaska south to the coastal redwoods of California, is also the most intact globally. We study these ecosystems for the rare second-chance they offer us to understand the forming and stabilizing factors that sustain this remarkable habitat for endemic bryophytes, sentinel trees, animals, and humankind.\nOur Alaskan coastal temperate rainforest research is currently supported by a US DOE BER Environmental System Science program award (2024-2027) and the ecoφlab’s rainforest network was established with past NSF support for a Coastal Margins Research Coordination Network."

Chicago’s built environment offers convenience, leisurely abundance, and an apparent overcoming of Nature’s chaotic and hostile forms. But our work in today’s Chicagolands focuses on something different; we take time to understand how the tiniest fragments of native soils persist, embedded in this vast expanse of human transformation. What might we lose if we forsake the last of these rare natural environments? In our most ambitious wetland restoration project yet, we pursue the answer to a question that the Chicagoan feat of engineering has almost obviated. Which of these expeirments in land use will prevail? Can what appears to be a flat shallows be in fact a terrain of elevation?"

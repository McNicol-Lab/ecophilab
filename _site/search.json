We aim to understand them holistically, from bedrock-to-canopy, using ecosystem concepts of composition, structure, and function. We describe cycles, identify feedback loops, and consider how ecosystem behavior changes across scales via emergence and self-organization."

With our strengths in quantifying, explaining, and predicting ecosystem function we position ourselves to contribute to future research to improve individual and collective health."

Metaphorically, it could also be interpreted as a request for personal or professional development, implying a desire to become more integrated or well-rounded in some aspect of life. Socially, to integrate into a group or activity - reflecting our lab’s commitment to inclusion."

In mathematics, phi (φ) often represents the golden ratio, an irrational number approximately equal to 1.618. In philosophy, phi can symbolize concepts such as harmony, balance, or perfection. Why include it in the name? Well, isn’t it obvious?"
